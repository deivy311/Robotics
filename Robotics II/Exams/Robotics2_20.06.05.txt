Exercise #1
A 3R planar robot is subject to hard joint velocity limits |q̇i | ≤ Vi , for i = 1, 2, 3, with V1 = 1,
V2 = 1.5, and V2 = 2 [rad/s]. At the current configuration, its task Jacobian is given by

                                        −1        −1      −0.5
                                                                  
                               J=
                                      −0.366 −0.866 −0.866
                                                      T
and the task requires a Cartesian velocity v = 2 1        [m/s]. Apply the SNS algorithm to find a
feasible solution q̇ ∈ R3 with the least possible norm, including task scaling if needed.

Exercise #2
Determine all the conditions on the constant parameters a, b, c and d, under which the following
(linear) equations can be considered the dynamic model of an actual 2-dof robot:

                             M q̈ + g = u,           with        q ∈ R2 , u ∈ R2 ,

where                                                                      
                                            a    b                        0
                                 M=                      ,       g=                .
                                            b    c                        d
Any guess about which type of robot this could be? Suppose now that only one generalized
coordinate is actuated by a command ua ∈ R, while the other is passive. Which component of u
should be actuated in order to guarantee the existence of an equilibrium? If we choose a value
ua > 0, what would be the instantaneous acceleration of the other (passive) coordinate?

Exercise #3
Consider the RP robot in Fig. 1, moving in a vertical plane. The prismatic joint has a limited
range d ≤ q2 ≤ L. Derive the gravity term g(q) in the dynamic model and find the expression (in
symbolic form) of a constant α > 0 that bounds k∂g(q)/∂qk for all q within the robot workspace.

The Cartesian robot in Fig. 2 has the two links respectively of mass m1 and m2 , and carries a
payload mp . It moves under gravity and has relevant viscous friction at both joints. In the absence
of a priori information on the dynamic parameters, design an adaptive control law yielding global
asymptotic stabilization of the tracking error for a desired trajectory q d (t).

Exercise #5
A robot should close a door by firmly grasping its handle, pushing the door to the final position,
and then turning the handle to prepare the door locking. This interaction task is sketched in
Fig. 3. Write down the natural and artificial constraints, defining a suitable task frame. Propose
a time behavior for the hybrid references so as to cover the pushing phase and the final locking of
the door. As usual in planning of hybrid force-velocity tasks, neglect any friction or environment
compliance.

                                                June 5, 2020

Exercise #1
The SNS algorithm at the velocity level starts with checking whether the minimum norm solution
is feasible with respect to the joint velocity bounds. Using the pseudoinverse of the Jacobian J
and the Cartesian velocity v, we compute
                                                              
                        −1.1333 0.9309                 −1.3358         < −V1 = −1 !!

q̇ 0 = q̇ P S = J v =  −0.2124 −0.3136            =  −0.7383  ⇐ ∈ [−V2 , V2 ] = [−1.5, 1.5]
                                                               
                                                 1

Therefore, we saturate the first joint velocity at its overdriven limit, q̇1 = −V1 = −1 [rad/s], and
recompute the task velocity v 1 that needs to be executed with the remaining two joints,
                                                              −1

where by J i , i = 1, 2, 3, we denote the columns of the Jacobian J . We rewrite then the reduced
problem as
                                −1       −0.5
                                                                 
                                                               q̇2
 J (−1) := J 2 J 3 =                             , q̇ (−1) :=            ⇒      J (−1) q̇ (−1) = v 1 ,

At this stage, the reduced solution is uniquely determined as
                                   −2 1.1547                   −1.2679

Recombining the joint velocity vector, we have the (minimum norm) feasible solution
                                                       

                                      q̇1,2       0.5359

and we can check that is satisfies indeed J q̇ ∗ = v. Thus, task scaling is not needed here.

Exercise #2
In order to be the dynamic model of an actual 2-dof robot, the only condition is on the parameters
a and c, which need to guarantee the positive definiteness of the inertia matrix M . Thus
                      
                  a b
          M=             >0       ⇐⇒        a > 0, det M = ac − b2 > 0 ⇒ c > 0.
                   b c

Being the inertia constant, there are no Coriolis and centrifugal effects. Also, friction is neglected.
The 2-dof robot could be a planar arm with two prismatic joints (2P), whose axes are twisted by
an angle α1 6= 0. Moreover, in order to include a constant gravity term only on the second joint,
the plane of motion is vertical and the first prismatic joint horizontal. We would have then for the
kinetic and potential energy
                       1          1
       T = T1 + T2 =     m1 q̇12 + m2 (q̇12 + q̇22 + 2 cos α1 q̇1 q̇2 ),   U = U2 = m2 g0 q2 sin α1 ,

where m1 > 0 and m2 > 0 are the masses of the two links, so that the inertia matrix and the
gravity vector for this 2P robot are

                 a b          m1 + m2 m2 cos α1             0             0
         M=              =                        ,  g=         =                   ,

with det M = m1 m2 + m22 (1 − cos α1 ) > 0. Note that the coefficient b = m2 cos α1 could be
positive or negative (depending on the twist angle |α1 | < π/2 or, respectively, > π/2). Same for
d = m2 g0 sin α1 (depending on the sign of α1 ).
Looking now at the equilibrium condition (i.e., q̈ = 0) in the underactuated case, it is evident that
the second joint has to be the actuated one,
                                                               

                                                     d         ua
The equilibrium force at the second joint is ua = d (= m2 g0 sin α1 ), the same for all equilibrium
configurations q e ∈ R2 . When choosing a value ua > 0, the instantaneous acceleration q̈1 of the
first (passive) joint is obtained from
                                             c −b                                −b

     q̈ =         = M −1 (u − g) =                                 =                  (ua − d),

and thus q̈1 = b(d − ua )/(ac − b2 ). Being the determinant of M positive, the sign of q̈1 will depend
on the sign of the product b(d − ua ). For instance, when b > 0 and for a large ua > |d|, the
acceleration of the first (passive) joint will be negative. On the other hand, the acceleration of the
second (actuated) joint will always be positive, as soon as the control force overcomes the gravity
term (ua > |d|).

Exercise #3
From Fig. 1, we have for the potential energy due to gravity
                         U (q) = U1 (q1 ) + U2 (q) = −m1 g0 d cos q1 − m2 g0 q2 cos q1 .
Therefore, using the compact notation for trigonometric quantities, we have
                                                                   

   2 One may notice that there is a unit inconsistency of the terms in the expression of α. In fact, we are taking the

norm of a matrix A(q) that has elements expressed in different units. This happens because the robot has joints
of different nature (revolute and prismatic): the gravity vector g(q) has the first component expressed in [Nm] (a
torque) and the second one in [N] (a force).

   • Despite the linear dynamics of the considered robot, the closed-loop system is indeed still
     nonlinear because of the interplay between the robot state x = (q, q̇) ∈ R4 and the state
     â ∈ R4 of the adaptive controller.

Exercise #5
With reference to Fig. 5, where a possible task frame is defined, the xt and z t axes of the task
frame have been chosen to coincide with the homologous ones at the door handle. The natural
constraints are the following:

                 vx = 0,         vz = 0,          ωx = 0,             ωz = 0,              fy = 0,        µy = 0.

In these constraints, we neglect any friction effect and mass/inertia or compliance of the environ-
ment (which is thus assumed to be purely geometric). The complementary artificial constraints
are chosen then as:

           fx = 0,       fz = 0,            µx = 0,         µz = 0,                vy = vd,y (t),         ωy = ωd,y (t).

The first four (zero) values for forces and moments that are assigned as references to the hybrid
task controller reflect the desire to limit the mechanical stress on the door handle grasped by the


                                                                  7
robot end-effector. The last two time-varying references are used instead to specify the way feasible
motions are handled during the task of closing a door. While moving the door, we set ωd,y = 0 (no
motion around the rotation axis y h = y t of the door handle). On the other hand, the time law
vd,y (t) will define the way the door closing should be performed, e.g., with a trapezoidal profile for
a rest-to-rest motion from the initial position (door open) to the desired approach position (door
nearly closed), using a fast or slow cruise speed. When the approach position is reached, the linear
motion is ended (vd,y = 0) and ωd,y (t) is used to turn the handle, preparing it for the final phase
of door locking. Note finally that when the door touches the door frame on the wall, the contact
situation changes and, accordingly, also the definition of natural and artificial constraints.

Therefore, only in the third case we are able to detect the occurrence of a collision with the
energy-based method.

As for the momentum-based method, a collision is detected (and possibly isolated) provided
                                                                                        n       F c is
                                                                                                o
                                                                                           T
not in the null space of the transpose of the contact Jacobian J c . In fact, if F c ∈ N J c (q) the
contact force is balanced by the reaction of the rigid robot structure, yielding τ c = J Tc (q)F c = 0
and thus not exciting the residual vector r. We verify next if the detection condition holds for the
three considered cases, drawing also conclusions on the isolation property. For the tip contact on
link 2:
                    −1 1                          −1
                                                                                   

       T
         o                                                   n
                                                                T
                                                                  o
                                                                               T            1
 N J c1 = N                    = ∅ ⇒ F c1 =              6∈ N J c1 , τ c1 = J c1 F c1 =         [Nm].
                     0 1                           0                                        0

Therefore, this collision will be detected with the momentum-based method (contrary to what
happens with the energy-based method). However, the second component r2 of the residual vector
will be unaffected (being τc1,2 = 0), leading to the wrong conclusion that the contact occurred on
link 1. Indeed, this is a singular situation for the isolation property (the contact force vector F c1
passes through the axis of joint 2). For the contact at the robot elbow:

                     −1 0
                                                           
    n    o                              0                      0         n    o
 N J Tc2 = N                     =α            ⇒ F c2 =             ∈ N J Tc2 , τ c2 = J Tc2 F c2 = 0.
                      0 0               1                     −1

Therefore, also the momentum-based method is not able to detect this collision. In fact, the contact
force vector F c2 passes through both joint axes and is balanced entirely by the internal reaction
force of the robot structure. Finally, for the contact at the midpoint of link 2:

                    −1 0.5
                                                                                         
   n    o                                           0         n    o                        0.5
N J Tc3 = N                      = ∅ ⇒ F c3 =            6∈ N J Tc3 , τ c3 = J Tc3 F c3 =         [Nm].
                     0 0.5                          1                                       0.5

Therefore, the momentum-based method detects the collision and also correctly isolates the contact
as occurring on the second link.
