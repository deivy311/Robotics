characteristics of direct adaptive control
n

n

n

large uncertainty on the robot dynamic parameters
poor knowledge of the inertial payload
direct aim is to bring to zero the state trajectory error, i.e.,
position and velocity errors
no need to estimate on line the true values of the dynamic
coefficients of the robot (as opposed to indirect adaptive control)

uncertain parameters that can be identified off line
n

n

masses 𝑚" , positions 𝑟-" of CoMs, and inertia matrices 𝐼" of each link,
appearing in combinations (dynamic coefficients)
⇒ 𝑝 ≪ 10×𝑁

parameters that are (slowly) varying during operation
n

n

kinematic description based, e.g., on Denavit-Hartenberg parameters
({𝛼" , 𝑑" , 𝑎" , 𝑖 = 1, … , 𝑁} in case of all revolute joints), including link
lengths (kinematic calibration)

viscous 𝐹5" , dry 𝐹6" , and stiction 𝐹7" friction at each joint ⇒ 1 ÷ 3×𝑁

unknown and abruptly changing parameters
n

mass, CoM, inertia matrix of the payload w.r.t. the tool center point

when a payload is firmly attached to the robot E-E, only the 10 parameters of the
last link are modified, influencing however most part of the robot dynamics

Goal of adaptive control
n

given a twice-differentiable desired joint trajectory 𝑞; (𝑡)
n
n

n

with known desired velocity 𝑞̇ ; (𝑡) and acceleration 𝑞̈ ; (𝑡)
possibly obtained by kinematic inversion + joint interpolation

execute this trajectory under large dynamic uncertainties
n

with a trajectory tracking error vanishing asymptotically

𝑒 = 𝑞; − 𝑞 ⟶ 0
n

n

n

𝑒̇ = 𝑞̇ ; − 𝑞̇ ⟶ 0

guaranteeing global stability, no matter how far are the initial
estimates of the unknown/uncertain parameters from their true
values and how large is the initial trajectory error

identification is not of particular concern: in general, the estimates of
dynamic coefficients will not to converge to the true ones!
if this convergence is a specific extra requirement, then one should
use (more complex) indirect adaptive schemes

Linear parameterization
𝑀 𝑞 𝑞̈ + 𝑆 𝑞, 𝑞̇ 𝑞̇ + 𝑔 𝑞 + 𝐹5 𝑞̇ = 𝑢
n

there exists always a (𝑝-dimensional) vector 𝑎 of dynamic
coefficients, so that the robot model takes the linear form

𝑌 𝑞, 𝑞,̇ 𝑞̈ 𝑎 = 𝑢
n
n

n

vector 𝑎 contains only unknown or uncertain coefficients
each component of 𝑎 is in general a combination of the
robot physical parameters (not necessarily all of them)
the model regression matrix 𝑌 depends linearly on 𝑞̈ ,
quadratically on 𝑞̇ (for the terms related to kinetic energy),
and nonlinearly (trigonometrically) on 𝑞

without extra assumptions, it can be shown only that joint velocities
become eventually “clamped” to those of the desired trajectory
(zero velocity error), but a permanent residual position error is left

Asymptotic stability of trajectory error
Theorem
The introduced adaptive controller makes the tracking error along
the desired trajectory globally asymptotically stable

𝑒 = 𝑞; − 𝑞 ⟶ 0, 𝑒̇ = 𝑞̇ ; − 𝑞̇ ⟶ 0

the time derivative of V is

1 Z
𝑉̇ = 𝑠 𝑀̇ 𝑞 𝑠 + 𝑠 Z 𝑀 𝑞 𝑠̇ + 𝑒 Z 𝑅𝑒̇ − 𝑎[ Z Γ UV 𝑎Ṅ

n

since 𝑎[̇ = −𝑎Ṅ (𝑎̇ = 0)
the closed-loop dynamics is given by

𝑀 𝑞 𝑞̈ + 𝑆 𝑞, 𝑞̇ 𝑞̇ + 𝑔 𝑞 + 𝐹5 𝑞̇ =
J 𝑞 𝑞̈ R + 𝑆O 𝑞, 𝑞̇ 𝑞̇ R + 𝑔N 𝑞 + 𝐹P5 𝑞̇ R + 𝐾L 𝑒 + 𝐾7 𝑒̇
=𝑀
subtracting the two sides from 𝑀 𝑞 𝑞̈ R + 𝑆 𝑞, 𝑞̇ 𝑞̇ R + 𝑔 𝑞 + 𝐹5 𝑞̇ R
leads to

𝑀(𝑞)𝑠̇ + 𝑆 𝑞, 𝑞̇ + 𝐹5 𝑠 =
` 𝑞 𝑞̈ R + 𝑆a 𝑞, 𝑞̇ 𝑞̇ R + 𝑔[ 𝑞 + 𝐹b5 𝑞̇ R − 𝐾L 𝑒 − 𝐾7 𝑒̇

J 𝑆a = 𝑆 − 𝑆,
O 𝑔[ = 𝑔 − 𝑔,

Proof
n

(cont)

from the property of linearity in the dynamic coefficients, it follows

𝑀(𝑞)𝑠̇ + 𝑆 𝑞, 𝑞̇ + 𝐹5 𝑠 = 𝑌 𝑞, 𝑞,̇ 𝑞̇ R , 𝑞̈ R 𝑎[ − 𝐾L 𝑒 − 𝐾7 𝑒̇
n

substituting in 𝑉,̇ together with 𝑎Ṅ = Γ𝑌 Z 𝑠, and using the skewsymmetry of matrix 𝑀̇ − 2𝑆 we obtain

12

Proof
n

(end)

defining now (all matrices are diagonal!)
leads to

Λ = 𝐾7UV 𝐾L > 0

𝑅 = 2𝐾L (𝐼 + 𝐾7UV 𝐹5 ) > 0

𝑉̇ = −𝑒 Z ΛZ (𝐹5 + 𝐾7 )Λ𝑒 − 𝑒̇ Z (𝐹5 + 𝐾7 )𝑒̇
= −𝑒 Z 𝐾L 𝐾7UV (𝐹5 + 𝐾7 )𝐾7UV 𝐾L 𝑒 − 𝑒̇ Z (𝐹5 + 𝐾7 )𝑒̇ ≤ 0

and thus

𝑉̇ = 0 ⟺ 𝑒 = 𝑒̇ = 0
the thesis follows from Barbalat lemma + LaSalle theorem
the set of states of convergence has zero trajectory error and
a constant value for 𝑎N , not necessarily the true one (𝑎[ ≠ 0)

Remarks

n

if the desired trajectory 𝑞; (𝑡) is persistently exciting, then also the
estimates of the dynamic coefficients converge to their true values

n

for linear systems: # of frequency components in the desired trajectory
should be at least twice as large as # of unknown coefficients
for nonlinear systems: the condition can be checked only a posteriori
(a certain motion integral should be permanently lower bounded)

in case of known absence of (viscous) friction (𝐹5 ≡ 0), the same
proof applies (a bit easier in the final part)
the adaptive controller does not require the inverse of the inertia
matrix (true or estimated), nor the actual robot acceleration (only the
desired acceleration), nor further lower bounds on 𝐾L > 0, 𝐾7 > 0
adaptation can be also used only for a subset of dynamic coefficients,
the remaining being known (𝑌𝑎 = 𝑌f;fgh 𝑎Nf;fgh + 𝑌ijklj 𝑎ijklj )
the non-adaptive version (using accurate estimates) is a static
tracking controller based on the passivity property of robot dynamics
